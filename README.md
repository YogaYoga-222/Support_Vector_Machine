# Support Vector Machine (SVM) Projects

## Program Details

### 1. `svm_spam_predictor.py`

- This program predicts whether a text message is **spam** or **not spam** (ham).
- It uses **TF-IDF** to convert text into numbers and **SVM (Linear)** to classify the messages.
- It shows the accuracy, prediction summary, sample predictions, and a detailed classification report.

### 2. `svm_eligibility_predictor.py`

- This program predicts whether a person is **eligible** or **not eligible** (for a job, scholarship, etc.).
- It uses features like **age**, **education level**, and **experience** from a dataset.
- It uses **Linear SVM** to make predictions.
- You can also give your own input (age, education, experience) and check the prediction in real time.

### 3. `svm_purchase_predictor.py`

- This program predicts whether a person will purchase a product or not.
- It uses data like age, estimated salary, and whether they viewed the ad.
- It uses Linear SVM to build the model.
- The program also shows why someone is likely or unlikely to purchase (age, salary, ad viewed).
- You can also give new input to check the prediction for a new person.

## What I Learned

* I understood how Linear SVM works for different types of data like text, eligibility, and product purchase.
* I learned to:
  * Handle both categorical and numerical data.
  * Use label encoding to convert Yes/No values into numbers.
  * Apply StandardScaler to normalize the input features.
* I practiced giving reasons for prediction, making the output more meaningful.
* I also learned how to avoid common warnings in pandas and improve my code structure.
* Overall, this task helped me understand how to apply SVM in real-world decision-making problems.
