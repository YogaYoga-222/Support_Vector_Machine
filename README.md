# Support Vector Machine (SVM) Projects

## Program Details

### 1. `svm_spam_predictor.py`

- This program predicts whether a text message is **spam** or **not spam** (ham).
- It uses **TF-IDF** to convert text into numbers and **SVM (Linear)** to classify the messages.
- It shows the accuracy, prediction summary, sample predictions, and a detailed classification report.

### 2. `svm_eligibility_predictor.py`

- This program predicts whether a person is **eligible** or **not eligible** (for a job, scholarship, etc.).
- It uses features like **age**, **education level**, and **experience** from a dataset.
- It uses **Linear SVM** to make predictions.
- You can also give your own input (age, education, experience) and check the prediction in real time.

### 3. `svm_purchase_predictor.py`

- This program predicts whether a person will purchase a product or not.
- It uses data like age, estimated salary, and whether they viewed the ad.
- It uses Linear SVM to build the model.
- The program also shows why someone is likely or unlikely to purchase (age, salary, ad viewed).
- You can also give new input to check the prediction for a new person.

### 4. `svm_credictcard_fraud_detection.py`

- This program predicts whether a credit card transaction is **fraud** or **legit**.
- It uses a cleaned CSV file (`credictcard.csv`) with features like `V1`, `V2`, ..., `V28`, and `Amount`.
- The target column is `Class`, where 0 = legit and 1 = fraud.
- The model uses **SVM with RBF (Gaussian) kernel** to handle non-linear data.
- It also shows a confusion matrix and classification report to check how well the model works.

## What I Learned

* I understood how SVM works for different types of problems like spam detection, eligibility check, product purchase prediction, and fraud detection.
* I learned how to handle both text and numeric data, and how to use TF-IDF or scaling when needed.
* I used label encoding, train-test splitting, and confusion matrix to understand model performance.
* I also learned how to improve output and make the code easier to understand.
* This project helped me apply SVM to real-world tasks in a clear and simple way.
