# Support Vector Machine (SVM) Projects

## Program Details

### 1. `svm_spam_predictor.py`

- This program predicts whether a text message is **spam** or **not spam** (ham).
- It uses **TF-IDF** to convert text into numbers and **SVM (Linear)** to classify the messages.
- It shows the accuracy, prediction summary, sample predictions, and a detailed classification report.

### 2. `svm_eligibility_predictor.py`

- This program predicts whether a person is **eligible** or **not eligible** (for a job, scholarship, etc.).
- It uses features like **age**, **education level**, and **experience** from a dataset.
- It uses **Linear SVM** to make predictions.
- You can also give your own input (age, education, experience) and check the prediction in real time.

## Requirements

Install the required Python libraries using:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn tabulate
```
---

## Files

- `svm_spam_predictor.py`: Predicts if a text message is spam or ham using Linear SVM and TF-IDF
- `spam.csv`:	Dataset with text messages labeled as 'ham' or 'spam'
- `svm_eligibility_predictor.py`:	Predicts if a person is eligible based on age, education, and experience
- `eligibility_data.csv`:	Dataset containing person details and eligibility label

## Run the Script 
```bash
python3 svm_spam_predictor.py
```
```bash
python3 svm_eligibility_predictor.py
```

## What I Learned

* I learned what SVM (Support Vector Machine) is and how to use it for classification problems.
* I practiced Linear SVM using real datasets for:
  * Spam detection from text messages.
  * Eligibility prediction based on personal details.
* I learned to:
  * Clean and prepare data using pandas.
  * Convert text to numbers using TF-IDF.
  * Scale numerical features.
  * Train and evaluate a model using SVM from scikit-learn.
* At first, the outputs were hard to read. I fixed and improved the formatting for better understanding.
* I also added user input support to test predictions for new data easily.
